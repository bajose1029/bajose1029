Hello Everyone! My name is Bayo and I am extremely excited to dive into
the world of coding! I took a few coding classes in Engineering School a
few years back, and really enjoyed it. This time around, I am very
serious about becoming proficient in the art that is computer science.
For me this looks like enrolling in Tech Elavator, a coding bootcamp,
and putting my best foot forward. I have some experience with C/C++ so
I am hoping that helps me in this journey! I hope to be on GitHub quite
frequently and to become more involved with this community! I am also a
professional musician so for all my musicians, singer/songwriters, hit me
up!
